# Question 2

## What are the problems of this architecture?
When too much users connect, each user should maintain enormous peers, but if I don't want to broadcast my message, most of peers are not used. As our chatroom is only supported the communication en text, the problem may not be very acute, but for a video chatroom, we suppose that a video and audio composed stream is 50Kb/s, then 100Kb/s per peer(upload and download). For a 2Mb/s bandwidth user, theoretically, the maximal connections are 20. In reality, the connections must be less than 20. So for a opened chatroom application, p2p is not recommended.   
## Describe an architecture that could solve those problems.
In these circumstances, I will import a server for every chatroom. Each peer in the same room keeps a connection with his server, this server can provide a `nameservice`, this `nameservice` maps name of the peer to his address. Members can keep locally the connections that they have created, and check their availabilities when somebody leaves room.
- To show online users: a peer can demand server to get the online users list.
- To broadcast: a peer wants to broadcast some messages, it can just send a message to room server with a tag ‘broadcast’, then this server can send to everyone in this room.
- To communicate between peers: when peer A wants to send a message to peer E, A will search the local connected peers, if E is not in this list, A will send a request to server, then server sends a message to E, then A and E can exchange configuration information through signalingServer(with help of IceServers) and create a p2p connection. A and E will keep this connection, in case that after a while, they will reuse this connection.
